update-ca-certificates is intended to maintain the system CA
certificates in /etc/ssl/certs. It does so by symlinking PEM files
from /usr/share/ca-certificates to /etc/ssl/certs. That way
distributions and administrators can install additional certificates
simply via packages.

Differences to Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- /etc/ca-certificates.conf serves as backlist or whitelist. If
  it's empty (=default) or only contains entries that start with '!'
  the file serves as backlist. Any entry that doesn't start with
  '!' turns the file into a whitelist so each trusted certificate
  has to be listed explicitly.
- hook scripts don't receive the list of changed certificates on
  stdin. That allows scripts have their own method to determine
  changes.
- The command line arguments -v and -f are passed to hook scripts.
- the CA bundle file is generated via hook script too.

OpenSSL trusted certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

openSSL supports 'trusted certificates' that can store additional
usage constraints and a certificate alias. Their PEM file format is
not supported by other SSL implementations though. So hook scripts
may need to convert such files to standard PEM format. To avoid
having to parse openssl output such certificates are expected to
contain additional "header fields" that list the usage constraints
and the alias. Example:
# alias=Deutsche Telekom Root CA 2
# trust=code-signing email-protection server-auth
# openssl-trust=codeSigning emailProtection serverAuth
